"The information provided in this table is based on DHB plans. We anticipate that there could be a potential variance of up to ten percent (plus or minus) in actual vaccination numbers. This is on the basis that, for example, an unplanned significant event could affect roll-out implementation or some DHBs might exceed their planned vaccination numbers. "
