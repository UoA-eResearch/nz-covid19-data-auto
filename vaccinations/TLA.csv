Ashburton District,5-11,"3,235","1,765",854,,,,,55%,26%,,,"Population is based on the population reported as being in the TLA at the time the HSU population was created for reporting purposes (December 2021).
Vaccination data will include individuals that are now 12 years and older, that were not included in the original HSU population, but are eligible to be vaccinated now. 
TLA2018 boundaries do not map cleanly to the DHB boundaries, meaning that the population numbers for all of NZ are correct, but aggregating to a DHB level will get a different number to that published. 
Vaccinations are based on the TLA of residence at the time of vaccination and again the numbers will not match exactly to the DHB numbers previously published. 
Data is extracted and aggregated to allow for comparison of vaccinations to population at a TLA level and may not be suitable for any other purpose.
The Ministry kindly requests that before publishing anything based on this data, that you allow the Ministry to review the messaging and numbers in case of any errors in the data. 
Data is aggregated and whilst all care is taken to maintain accuracy, there may be some minor errors that should not impact on overall percentages.
Population, first and second dose data is for individuals in the age range shown.  First booster data is for individuals 18+ and second booster data is for individuals 50+.
